# Codsoft-2_IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
This repository contains a machine learning project that classifies Iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal measurements. This project utilizes the Iris dataset, which is a classic example for introductory classification tasks in machine learning.

Overview
The Iris dataset consists of three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each species is distinguished based on four features:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model to accurately classify Iris flowers into one of these three species based on their measurements.

Dataset
The Iris dataset is included in the scikit-learn library and contains the following:

Features:
sepal length (cm)
sepal width (cm)
petal length (cm)
petal width (cm)
Target:
species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:


Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. The required libraries can be installed using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Notebooks
The project is divided into Jupyter notebooks for easy understanding and modularity:

Data Exploration: 01-data-exploration.ipynb

Initial data loading and exploration.
Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
Data Preprocessing: 02-data-preprocessing.ipynb

Handling any necessary preprocessing steps (though minimal for the Iris dataset).
Model Building: 03-model-building.ipynb

Selecting and training various machine learning models.
Hyperparameter tuning.
Model Evaluation: 04-model-evaluation.ipynb

Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: 05-prediction.ipynb

Making predictions on new data.
Scripts
data_preprocessing.py: Contains functions for preprocessing the data.
model.py: Contains functions for building and training the machine learning models.
utils.py: Utility functions used across the project.
Results
The final model performance and predictions are stored in the results/ directory. Detailed evaluation metrics and model selection rationale are documented in the 04-model-evaluation.ipynb notebook.
